SomaFM-listener
===============

As an avid listener of SomaFM's Defcon channel, I got tired of having to update my Spotify playlists manually.
While running, this small program keeps monitoring a channel's 'recently played' history. Every track gets stored in a SQLite database and searched for on Spotify.
When the track can be found on Spotify, it gets added to your playlist.

> python somafm-listener <your Spotify username> <SomaFM channel name>
